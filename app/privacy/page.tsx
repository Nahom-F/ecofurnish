        This is a template covering what EcoFurnish&apos;s own code actually
        collects and does — it&apos;s a reasonable starting point, but isn&apos;t
        legal advice. Have it reviewed before relying on it for a real
        business.

          <h2>What we collect</h2>
          <p>
            When you place an order, we collect your name, email, phone
            number, and shipping address to fulfil it. If you create an
            account, we store your name, email, and a securely hashed
            password. If you use the contact form, we collect your name,
            email, and message.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>What we don&apos;t collect</h2>
          <p>
            We never see or store your payment card details — those are
            handled entirely by our payment provider, Chapa.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Cookies and local storage</h2>
          <p>
            Your cart, wishlist, and theme preference (light/dark) are
            stored in your browser&apos;s local storage, not on our servers.
            Signing in sets a session cookie so you stay logged in.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Third parties</h2>
          <p>
            We share order details with Chapa to process payment, and use
            Resend to send order confirmation and contact form emails.
            Neither is used for advertising.

          <h2>Deleting your data</h2>
          <p>
            If you have an account, sign in and go to{" "}
            <a href="/account" className="text-primary hover:underline">
              Account
            </a>
            , then choose Delete Account. You&apos;ll get a confirmation email —
            clicking the link in it permanently deletes your account and
            personal data. If you can&apos;t sign in (for example you&apos;ve lost
            access to the email or social account you signed up with), reach
            us through the{" "}
            <a href="/contact" className="text-primary hover:underline">
              contact page
            </a>{" "}
            and we&apos;ll delete it manually — we&apos;ll ask enough about the order
            or account to make sure we&apos;re deleting the right one.
          </p>
        </div>
