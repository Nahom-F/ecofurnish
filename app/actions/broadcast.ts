 * `all-customers` is meant for genuinely important, infrequent notices
 * (a policy change, a security notice) — treated like the existing order
 * emails, no unsubscribe link, because there's no reasonable way to "opt
 * out" of account-related notices short of deleting the account. It is
 * NOT the list for regular updates/promotions — that's what the opt-in
 * `subscribers` audience and its existing unsubscribe machinery are for.
 * `drivers` follows the same no-unsubscribe reasoning as all-customers —
 * an operational notice to active drivers, not a marketing list — and
 * only reaches approved, non-blacklisted drivers who have an email on
 * file, which won't be all of them (email is optional for drivers; see
 * getApprovedDriverEmails above). Sending routine marketing to every
 * account holder is what gets a sending domain flagged as spam, which
 * would also degrade delivery of the verification/reset-password emails
 * sharing that same domain.
