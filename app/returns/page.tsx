          <h2>30-day return window</h2>
          <p>
            You can return most items within 30 days of delivery for a
            refund. The 30 days is counted from the delivery date on your
            order, not the order date.

          <h2>Condition</h2>
          <p>
            Items must be unused, in their original condition, and in the
            original packaging. Items that show signs of use or assembly
            can&apos;t be accepted for a refund.

        <div>
          <h2>Return shipping</h2>
          <p>
            Return shipping is paid by the buyer, unless the item arrived
            damaged, defective, or wasn&apos;t what you ordered — in that case
            we cover it.

        <div>
          <h2>Refunds</h2>
          <p>
            Once we&apos;ve received and inspected the returned item, we&apos;ll
            process your refund to your original payment method. Refunds
            can take a few business days to appear, depending on your bank
            or mobile money provider.
