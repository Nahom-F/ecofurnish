    // only cross-origin script/frame, Leaflet's OSM tiles are the only
    // extra image host, and every other external call (Chapa, Gemini/Groq,
    // Telegram, geocoding, FX rates) happens from Server Actions/route
    // handlers, never the browser — none of those belong in a
    // browser-facing CSP. Chapa's checkout itself is a full top-level
    // redirect (window.location.href in app/checkout/page.tsx), not a
    // fetch/frame/form-post, so it needs no entry either.
    //
    // NOT nonce-based, deliberately: app/page.tsx is statically generated
    // (`export const revalidate = 300`) and served from cache to every
    // visitor, but a nonce has to be unique per request. A per-request
    // middleware nonce doesn't match the nonce baked into that cached
    // HTML's inline hydration scripts, so the browser silently refuses to
    // run them — the page renders its skeleton shell and never hydrates.
    // (Confirmed this the hard way — see chat.) Next's own CSP guide notes
    // this exact limitation: "pages must be dynamically rendered to use
    // nonces." Forcing the homepage dynamic just to enable nonces would
    // undo the ISR caching it was deliberately built with, so script-src
    // keeps 'unsafe-inline' instead — a real but smaller relaxation than
    // it sounds, since the origin allowlisting below still does most of
    // CSP's actual work (blocking exfiltration to and execution of
    // scripts from anywhere not explicitly listed here).

    // Vercel's preview-only Toolbar/Live-Feedback overlay

    // needs a few extra sources; VERCEL_ENV is fixed per-deployment (not
    // per-request), so resolving it here — instead of per-request in
    // middleware — is both correct and one less moving part. Production
    // visitors never load vercel.live at all, so this never widens the
    // production policy.
