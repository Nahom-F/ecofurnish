          <h2>Using this site</h2>
          <p>
            By creating an account or placing an order, you agree to these
            terms. You must be able to form a legally binding contract to

          <p>
            Placing an order is an offer to buy, which we may accept or
            decline (for example, if an item is out of stock or priced
            incorrectly). Payment is processed securely by Chapa — we
            never see or store your card details. Prices, product
            descriptions, and availability may change at any time.
